    <h2>engineering lead based in glasgow, scotland</h2>
    <p>
      With 10 years industry experience under my belt, I’ve worked across all
      areas of web development; creating cohesive, multi-discipline projects
      both as part of a team and as a solo developer. Working in companies where
      I can make a tangible impact through my work, I’ve been involved in the
      fashion, music and entertainment verticals from an eComms perspective, and
      I’ve pushed to create new solutions across the UK’s fintech and medtech
      sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complex projects are my bread and butter. Currently I'm working as a
      full-stack Lead Engineer for an industry-leading SaaS in the Architectural
      world, helping accelerate the modelling process for millions of users at
      all scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you think I'd fit in with
      your team, or are looking for a freelancer, please
