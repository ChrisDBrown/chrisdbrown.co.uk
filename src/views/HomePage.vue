    <h2>engineering lead based in glasgow, scotland</h2>
    <p>
      With 9 years industry experience under my belt, I’ve worked across all
      areas of web development; creating cohesive, multi-discipline projects
      both as part of a team and as a solo developer. Working in companies where
      I can make a tangible impact through my work, I’ve been involved in the
      fashion, music and entertainment verticals from an eComms perspective, and
      I’ve pushed to create new solutions across the UK’s fintech and medtech
      sectors.

    <p>
      Complex projects are my bread and butter. Currently, on a daily basis I
      work with React and PHP in a microservice environment, focusing on
      trustable solutions in the security-focused finance space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you think I'd fit in with
      your team, or are looking for a freelancer, please
