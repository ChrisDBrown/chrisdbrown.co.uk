I first started working with the web when I was given the task of updating my high school's 5-years-out-of-date website, mostly to keep me out of trouble. Fortunately it worked better than could have been expected - I've been fascinated with the web and its effect on people's daily lives ever since.

Since then I've moved through various roles in the industry, from freelancer-for-hire to agency newbie to technical team lead. Today I'm working for a Glasgow based company, leading a mixed team of developers in building a modern, fashion-focused eCommerce platform.

I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you think I'd fit in with your team, or are looking for a freelancer, please [drop me an email](mailto:owner@chrisdbrown.co.uk) or [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdeebrown).
