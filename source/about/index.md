I first started working with the web when I was given the task of updating my high school's 5-years-out-of-date website, mostly to keep me out of trouble. Fortunately it worked better than could have been expected - I've been fascinated with the web and its effect on people's daily lives ever since.

Now I work for a Glasgow-based agency on clients ranging from tiny startups to multi-national conglomerates, using a wide spread of modern web & mobile technologies. The main focus of my work is on first building bespoke back-end systems, and then the technical side of the front-ends that will use them, whether that be database driven sites, modern javascript web tools, or cross-platform mobile apps.

In an average week, I'll be working with:
- the cutting edge of JavaScript (ES6) and related tooling technologies such as [Bower](https://bower.io/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and [browserify](https://browserify.org/)
- a variety of Javascript frameworks and components like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- PHP based backends, with sites including [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- ... and the ever-relevant HTML5 & CSS3 standards

This should help give an idea of the spread of work that I can do. I'm constantly looking to expand my skillset and keep up with the ever-changing world of web development.

I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you think I'd fit in with your team, please [drop me an email](mailto:owner@chrisdbrown.co.uk) or [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdeebrown). You can also [view my formal CV](/CV.pdf).
