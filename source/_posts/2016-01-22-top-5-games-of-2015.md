Well, somehow it's 2016 already. Who knows how that happened. 2015 has been a hell of a year for videogames on both the indie and triple-A ends of the spectrum. Even the clockwork machines put out good versions of The Thing They Make this year, by most accounts.
What's better still is that this year has seen the hard line that used to exist between indie and triple-A gaming break down more and more. Now it's all just a murky soup of videogames, and it's great.

Anyway, here's some hot opinions.

<br />

###5. Rise of the Tomb Raider
_Self-Improvement award for Best Sequel_

The main theme of 2015 was surprises. I was not a fan of Tomb Raider (2013, not 1996 (this needs to stop)), as much as I enjoyed the way it played. The torture-porn nature of the action and the obvious glee taken at damaging Lara wasn't for me.

Thankfully Crystal Dynamics seems to have had the same idea. There's none of that this time around. In fact, they've taken steps to improve and tighten every part of the game - the combat is cleaner, the upgrades feel worthwhile, there's actual challenge in the optional challenge tombs, and it really feels like Lara has came into her own. There's one scene in the latter half of the game that has you relentlessly breaking through enemy lines, and hearing hardened guards terrified that 'the Croft girl' had me grinning like a psychotic.

My main issue with is that the supporting characters are all quite one-note, even with all the optional collectibles kicking about. In fact, some of the characters you never meet seem more rounded than the god-driven Konstantin. There's no surprises in the plot, as much as it tries, but it's still entertaining enough to keep moving through.

Overall though this is a masterclass at how to make a sequel, although maybe by the next game she'll have learned to steal people's guns rather than just rifling through their pockets.

###4. Hacknet
_Acid Burn award for Fastest Typing_

Mr Robot was probably my favourite TV series of 2015. It's refreshingly accurate portrayal of hacking laced with subtle use of an unreliable narrator and set against the modern financial backdrop really struck a chord with me. Hacknet is the other side of the coin - Swordfish-ass hollywood hacking.

If you've ever played Introversion Software's classic hack-the-gibson sim Uplink then you'll know exactly what to expect here. The entire game is experienced through a linux desktop with a simple graphic interface and terminal. You can - and I would recommend you do - play the vast majority of the game just through terminal commands. Though very limited, each command in their accepted toolset works exactly like it's real life counterpart.

The embellished commands are what move the story forward - rather than spending hours and days trying to get into a system you've a set of magic keys that break through firewalls, crack SSH keys and open systems to your prying eyes (there's a justification for you having all these, but it's a main beat of the ending so I'll leave it out here). These tools gain you a meteoric rise through the grey-hat hacker leagues to ever-sketchier groups, which give you more tools and harder challenges in a nicely-paced feedback loop. At the same time you're trying to track down a missing member of these groups - it's very reminiscent of 2010's Digital: A Love Story, and I suspect Digital was a strong influence on Hacknet.

Where Hacknet really pushes itself above being just a good one of these - which, honestly, might have got it on this list anyway - is the way it plays with players expectations. Just as you get into the rhythm of 'take a job, hack a machine, report back' you'll come across hints of exactly how you came to get your advanced toolkit in a throwaway, missable email, or get sucked into playing a Clicker game, or - in a particularly memorable moment - have your machine counter-hacked by someone you've wronged and have them delete your graphical settings, sending you on a terminal-only quest to get your machine back up to speed.

It's a perfectly paced skill-builder, meshing story and gameplay together into a climactic final-boss like moment that has you typing furiously against the clock as the excellent techno-beat soundtrack ramps up beautifully. There's a few low points - some of the optional hacks can be repetitive - but overall it's a very tight password-stealing package.

###3. Cibele
_Ragnarok Online award for Best Fake MMO_

I picked up Cibele on a whim knowing nothing about it other than that it kept being mentioned on my Twitter feed, and ended up playing it in a single sitting late at night and destroying all hope of getting work done the next day. Still, I'm not sure quite what it was that made me unable to put it down. My first impression of Cibele was one of discomfort - the game opens with you sitting at a PC clicking through chat logs and photos and all the other incredibly personal information we store on machines, and I didn't have enough of a picture of the character to not feel like I was prying.

<div class="img_row">

</div>
<div class="col three caption">
  Definitely not my computer
</div>

This, however, is the most interesting thing about Cibele. It's an auto-biographical game by Nina Freeman about a failed online relationship through an online game. There's three main components: the computer-clicky-ready parts showing Nina's life outside the game, the fake MMO "Valtameri" sections with love interest Blake, and FMV sequences starring Nina as herself and her real-life partner Emmett Butler as Blake. Over several chapters the story of Blake and Nina's awkward, burgeoning first love is played out with a striking honesty that is rarely seen over any medium, and seeing it in a video game is hugely exciting.

The setting was instantly relateable to me. During high school I spent far too many nights playing MMOs with people I'd never met but knew very well, jumping windows haphazardly between MSN Messenger and music players and whatever we were playing then, and all this is the backdrop that Nina and Blake's relationship is set against. That relationship is recognizable too, all awkward flirting and careful dancing of two young people unsure of their own feelings and terrified of each others.

Cibele is - for now - a rare work in games of an author telling their story frankly and openly, and the fact that games like this can exist now makes me hopeful for what's to come.

###2. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
_GCHQ award for Most Likely to Get Me Arrested_

Here's a brief look at a conversation I had with my Dad last night:

<br />

<a href="/img/goty2015-keep-talking.png"><img class="col" src="/img/goty2015-keep-talking.png" title="Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"></a>
<div class="col three caption">
  Thanks, Dad
</div>

Now, I knew what he meant, but just to clarify for all the shady government agencies reading my messages - this was about a videogame. Which is amazing in itself. Even during the height of Wii-mania father dearest stayed out of it, but one look at Keep Talking while I was home for the holidays had him hooked.

The premise of Keep Talking is simple: one player has a computer screen in front of them with a bomb on it, and everyone else has a printed book of bomb defusal instructions. Screen-player describes what's on the bomb, and everyone else scrambles to tell them how to defuse it before time runs out. Simple, right?

Of course, each type of bomb module - a mini-puzzle, of which there can be up to 12 per bomb - has it's own set of rules. Does the bomb have more than two batteries on it? What colours are on the simon says board? What letter was that burst of morse code? The challenge ramps up enough to keep things interesting.

The real magic for me is how easy it is to get all kinds of people involved - no-one needs to be a videogame expert. If you've ever watched a movie character wonder what colour wire to cut then you're qualified. Hearing my family argue over which button to press with the seconds ticking down was hugely entertaining, as it has been with every group I've played with.

Not sure I'd trust them with a real bomb though.

###1. Undertale
_Tumblr award for Most Rabid Fanbase_

And here was my biggest surprise of the year - I didn't hate Undertale. All the buzz I heard around it was "The characters are sooo random! One only talks in comic sans!" and "You don't need to kill anyone!" which all sounded like some happy-clappy crap to me. Boy, was I wrong. This side of the game is a massive misdirection - hiding under the jokes and kitsch is a surprisingly deep, heartfelt and bleak world.

<a href="/img/goty2015-undertale.png"><img class="col" src="/img/goty2015-undertale.png" title="Undertale"></a>
<div class="col three caption">
  The jokes are pretty good too
</div>

Messing with the players expectations is a running theme through the game. Despite being an almost solo effort by Toby Fox it seems to predict every action taken, no matter how odd, and have a clever response ready, whether it be a throwaway gag or suddenly changing tracks for the plot and mood of the rest of this playthrough. Another oddity, this - it's an RPG designed to be played through multiple times to see as much as possible, and in fact requires a few runs to get the "best" endings. Thankfully it clocks in at about 5 hours even on your first blind run so it's not too arduous a task.

Over the course of multiple runs Undertale starts opening out it's deeper narrative of weaving what would normally just be handwaved as game mechanics into the plot - specifically your saving, loading, and restarting the game. Characters begin to remember what you've done on previous playthroughs, both good and bad, and react accordingly, just as your own knowledge of the game starts to inform decisions made at critical points, in turn affecting the final outcome this time round. This interconnection is what makes the game so affecting - even resurrecting a character you've previously murdered doesn't absolve you of your actions. For me, this made me unable to play through what's known as a genocide run, which involves killing off every character and every enemy until random encounters are left without opponents. I'd came to like the many quirky characters, and sure, I could reset, but they'd know. And I'd know. I couldn't bring myself to do it.

<div class="col three caption">
  No-one's left to kill, you monster
</div>

Genocide runs are an extreme example of the ways in which the world shapes itself around your actions. You are every bit a driving force in Undertale, with the power to save or ruin everything you touch on both a personal or a global level, and manages to conjoin these in a way that few larger-scale RPG manage. Every interaction feels meaningful, and what few side quests exist drastically affect the main story while being completely missable and optional. Everything feels like one complete package, with one unfortunate exception. The first hour or so of the game was built as a demo for crowdfunding backers years before the main game came out, and lacks the polish and finesse of the rest of the game. It's unfortunate, as I imagine a lot of people are put off by and never get past it. While it serves as a good introduction to the mechanics of the game it does drag on too long without much variation.

Despite this blip Undertale is a fascinating deconstruction of RPGs and how we interact with games in general, backed with a great sense of humor and fresh combat mechanics that make this a solid winner in a year filled with great games.
