With 6 years’ industry experience under my belt, I’ve worked across all areas of web development; creating cohesive, multi-discipline projects both as part of a team and as a solo developer. Working in companies where I can make a tangible impact through my work, I’ve been involved in the fashion, music and entertainment verticals from an eComms perspective, and I’ve pushed to create new solutions across the UK’s fintech and medtech sectors.

Complex projects are my bread and butter. Currently, on a daily basis I work with NodeJS, React and PHP in a microservice environment, focusing on trustable solutions in the security-focused finance space.

I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you think I'd fit in with your team, or are looking for a freelancer, please [drop me an email](mailto:owner@chrisdbrown.co.uk) or [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdeebrown).
